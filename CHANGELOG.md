# Changelog

Notable changes, newest first. The format is [Keep a Changelog][kac] and the
versions are [semantic][semver]. The release workflow reads the section matching
the tag, so every release needs one.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.1]

The first release, and a deliberately small number: this one is here to prove the
build and the release path rather than to be depended on.

A distributed lighting console — a show engine that several stations share, a
tiled web workspace to run it from, and the output and device layers that reach a
rig.

### Added

- **The show engine.** Cues, sequences, playback with fades and follow-ons, and a
  programmer buffer that outranks playback until it is cleared or stored.
- **Peer sync.** Stations find each other over mDNS, converge from an oplog,
  elect a leader, and survive losing one.
- **Output.** Art-Net, sACN and OpenHaunt nodes, several at once, configured from
  the show rather than from the command line.
- **Devices and flows.** OpenHaunt I/O nodes are discovered, adopted as fixtures,
  and wired to cues through a node graph that shows its own state.
- **The stage.** A calibrated ground plan and the same rig in 3D, with pan and
  tilt puppeteered by grabbing a ring, an arc, or the beam spot on the floor.
- **A tiled workspace.** Panels in a tree of splits and tab groups, with layouts
  saved into the show.
- **Desktop apps.** `pult-gui` runs a console and its server in one window;
  `openhaunt-sim-gui` is a window onto a simulated node.
- **One artifact per product.** The frontend is built into the server binary, so
  a station serves its own console — and any tablet on the network gets the same
  one.
